# EVDA: Evolving Deepfake Audio Detection Continual Learning Benchmark
This is the official project of the Evolving Deepfake Audio Detection Continual Learning Benchmark. Everyone is welcome to study, discuss, and research together! :partying_face:

## Introduction
With the roll-out of advanced models like GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude, as well as the rapid development of speech generation technology, the line between real and synthetic voices is getting blurrier, making it tough for us to tell them apart just by listening. This trend raises a pressing question: how can we identify these constantly evolving generated speech? To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new benchmark. This benchmark utilizes various continual learning methods to effectively detect generated and falsified audio, making it easier for the research community to dive deeper into this field.
## News
We have initially uploaded our paper to GitHub, and it will be updated on the arXiv official website shortly.
