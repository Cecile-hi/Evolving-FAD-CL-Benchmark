# Towards Robust Audio Deepfake Detection: An Evolving Benchmark for Continual Learning

This repository hosts the official project of the paper ["Towards Robust Audio Deepfake Detection: An Evolving Benchmark for Continual Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08596)!

## Introduction

With the roll-out of advanced models like GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude, as well as the rapid development of speech generation technology, the line between real and synthetic voices is getting blurrier, making it tough for us to tell them apart just by listening. This trend raises a pressing question: how can we identify these constantly evolving generated speech? To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new benchmark. This benchmark utilizes various continual learning methods to effectively detect generated and falsified audio, making it easier for the research community to dive deeper into this field.

Test your deepfake audio detection model’s continual learning ability using our benchmark, which supports various state-of-the-art methods.🥳
